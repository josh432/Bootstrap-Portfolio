# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This assignment was to recreate my basic portfolio page using the Bootstrap Framework. It certainly looks better than my first personal page! I don't have this deployed as it it currently out of date. However, I like looking back on it now and then to see my progress. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
